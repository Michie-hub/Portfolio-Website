  <h1 class="h3">JAVA</h1>
  <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its portability and use in enterprise-level applications. It was one of the first languages I studied in depth, and it laid the foundation for my understanding of core programming concepts like classes, inheritance, interfaces, and data structures.</p>

    <p>While I haven’t yet used Java in a deployed project, it has been incredibly valuable in shaping how I think about program design, especially when building the backend logic for my projects using JavaScript or Python. Java helped me develop clean, modular code. For example, when I was working on the CyberSafe Blog Platform, the way I structured routes and middleware in Node.js was heavily influenced by my experience creating well-organized classes and methods in Java.
