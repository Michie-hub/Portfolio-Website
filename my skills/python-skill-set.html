  <h1 class="h5">PYTHON</h1>
  <p>Python is a powerful, readable, and beginner-friendly programming language, widely used in AI, data science, web development, and automation.</p>

    <p>I used Python as the core language in my AI-Powered Chatbot project. I wrote Python scripts to connect with OpenAI's API, parse user messages, and generate smart, human-like responses. I also integrated sentiment analysis and session management to make the chatbot feel more context-aware. The app was deployed using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, which made it easy to serve the chatbot through a browser.
    This project was my introduction to applied AI, and it inspired me to learn more about machine learning and NLP.
