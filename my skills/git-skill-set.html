  <h1 class="h1">GIT</h1>
<p>Git is a version control system that allows me to track and manage changes in my codebase. It’s essential for collaborating, experimenting, and maintaining clean development workflows.</p>

  <p>I use Git in every project. With GitHub, I store my code online and showcase it to others. During the development of the E-commerce Website, I regularly committed updates, created branches to test features, and merged them once they were stable. If something went wrong, Git made it easy to roll back to a previous version.
  Git has taught me discipline and organization as a developer. I’ve also learned the importance of writing clear commit messages and maintaining clean history for future collaboration.
