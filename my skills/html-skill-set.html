  <h1 class="h2">HTML - CSS</h1>
  <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create the structure of webpages. It defines elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and lists — essentially everything you see on a page.</p>

   <p> In my projects, I write clean, semantic HTML to ensure that my websites are accessible, SEO-friendly, and easy to maintain. For example, in the CyberSafe Blog Platform, I used HTML5 tags to improve structure and readability. I also used forms with input validation to collect user comments securely.
    I take pride in using HTML not just to build content, but to create a solid foundation for design and functionality.</p>


   <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls the visual appearance of webpages. With CSS, I bring life to my HTML by adjusting layout, color, spacing, animations, and more.
  </p> 

   <p>I used CSS heavily in both the E-commerce Website and Blog Platform. I implemented Flexbox and CSS Grid to ensure responsive design across different screen sizes. I also styled components with hover effects, transitions, and clean, readable typography to create modern and user-friendly interfaces.
    CSS lets me express creativity and attention to detail — something I really enjoy while designing user interfaces.
