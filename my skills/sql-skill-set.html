  <h1 class="h6">SQL</h1>

<p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for interacting with relational databases. It allows me to create, read, update, and delete data efficiently. Understanding SQL is essential for backend development and data-driven applications.</p>

<p>I’ve used SQL to manage structured data, especially when designing features that require strong data integrity — such as storing user accounts, product inventory, and blog post metadata. In the E-commerce Website, for example, I prototyped the database design using SQL to define relationships between users, products, and orders. I wrote queries to fetch user-specific shopping data, filter product categories, and handle secure user login data using hashed credentials.
</p>
<p>
Even though my deployed projects use NoSQL (like MongoDB), SQL has helped me understand the logic behind relational data and how to optimize data queries for performance. It’s a core skill I continue to develop as I grow into more complex applications involving data modeling and analytics.</p>
